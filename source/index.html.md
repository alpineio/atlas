# Introduction
Atlas is a a custom post type manager for WordPress. Extends Piklist and native WordPress functionality.

## Synopsis

Piklist does a great job of adding datastructure to WordPress.  About Piklist:

"Piklist is a code-based framework, which means it has no user interface. We believe this is one of the biggest
benefits to using Piklist. Code based systems allow you flexibility in your field configurations and development,
and will save you time in the long run. With Piklist you can usually use the same code you have written in one
section and use it in another, allowing you to copy and paste, and save tons of time."

We agree with the benefits of a code-based, source-controlled application.   But, we feel that copy-paste is not
a sustainable model for large-scale application development.

Atlas is a layer over the copy/paste configuration model.   A convenient, object-oriented layer for adding
basic and custom functionality to extended post types using a style similar to Laravel.

As they say about Laravel, it is "an accessible, yet powerful system, providing tools needed for large, robust
applications".  We envision the same for Atlas in the WordPress ecosystem.
